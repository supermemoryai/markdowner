# Markdowner ⚡📝

A fast tool to convert any website into LLM-ready markdown data.

## 👀 Why?

I'm building an AI app called Supermemory - https://git.new/memory. Where users can store website content in the app and then query it using AI. One thing I noticed was - when data is structured and predictable (in markdown format), the LLM responses are _much_ better.

There are other solutions available for this - https://r.jina.ai, https://firecrawl.dev, etc. But they are either:

- too expensive / proprietary
- or too limited.
- very difficult to deploy

Here's a quote from my friend [@nexxeln](https://github.com/nexxeln)

So naturally, we fix it ourselves ⚡

## Tech

Under the hood, Markdowner utilises Cloudflare's [Browser rendering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/) and [Durable objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) to spin up browser instances and then convert it to markdown using Turndown.
